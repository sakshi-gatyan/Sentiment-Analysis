Apprehensive-Sir7063,"Sure

But as an early adopter of AI and robotics roll out across multiple sectors could see increased investment from abroad especially if the UK didn't use AI and robotics taxes in the early stages to offset job loss impact on GDP. 

Very large markets such as the US and EU could see massive job loss and heavier regulation to slow the implementation

This could be an opportunity for the UK to attract investment from multiple sectors as well as attract these tech companies themselves

London for example could be an excellent HQ for Microsoft a place of implementation to roll out projects across the EU in various different companies working in an English environment with multiple nationalities, London is well suited for this.

They could attract this tech investment and implement AI in organisations such as the NHS ie the UK could be a proving ground and negate some of the job loss. 

As other countries regulate the UK could take a different approach in the initial stages. 

If the UK also limited migration extended the use of temporary visas increased apprenticeships and altered the degrees and career paths universities offer to guide people into future proof career opportunities the impact of this job loss could be dramatically mitigated. At the same time as this the UK could focus increases in welfare and roll out of universal income to specific groups such as parents with young children before mass adoption across the population, ie up until they start school for a limited number of children ie 2. So this will help support people in shrinking industries also with less need to change careers just career breaks. 

Universities may become tuition free for certain subjects particularly STEM and ability for people to retrain with second degrees also beneficial  in limiting job loss  so large scale job loss and increased universal income and welfare can be transitioned in with initial alterations removing people from the job market for beneficial reasons. 

As a single market the EU could see large movement of people when job loss it's creating a burden or decline of some countries or cities. 

Seems brexit may protect the UK through a transitional phase of AI and robotics integration. 

Freedom of movement may be limited in the EU depending on the impact but mroe likely is stringent rules and regulations to slowly role out AI. 

The UK has an opportunity really they cna fudge it or it could be an we'd economic benefit, AI and robotics revolution doesn't have to be a disaster for the UK at all. 

It'll be one of the early adopters and a focal point for tech companies wishing to gain access to the EU market using the UK as an example.",2024-03-31 13:31:46,1

MassiveWasabi,"> Humanity could create an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that is just as smart as humans in as soon as the next three years

AI agents that are as smart as humans. If we don’t consider robots or embodied AGI and only consider cognitive tasks, I’m pretty sure this will be achieved within a year at most. I’m not sure if people missed this or not, but they already showcased Claude 3 being able to act as an agent to achieve a task using the web. It can even spin up what they call “subagents” and break up a more complex task into parts and delegate to these subagents to complete these subtasks in parallel. It was in [this video](https://youtu.be/sjL6Gl6ZIqs?si=k_bkMwXasZp6nRKK) where Anthropic states that they’ve given Claude 3 extensive training on tool use.

OpenAI has been working on autonomous agents since before the release of GPT-4, and we haven’t heard a peep from them in this field. This is just my opinion but I think either OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind will be able to create an AI agent as smart as humans by next year. However, whether or not they release this to the public (with full capabilities and not artificially hamstrung) by next year is a completely different question.",2024-03-06 18:25:57,88

icemelter4K,"Asked ChatGPT to take my original post and ""Vice-ify"" it so it's gentler on the soul:

In the chaotic dance of city life, where narratives intermingle and diverge, the plight of the homeless offers a canvas painted in shades of gray. While some find themselves adrift in the streets through circumstances beyond their control, others seem to have charted their own course into destitution. As we navigate this complex terrain, it's crucial to parse the spectrum of experiences that define homelessness, understanding that respect, like the city streets, is not always a one-way thoroughfare.



Consider those whose journey into homelessness was paved with the jagged stones of misfortune. A medical emergency, an immigrant's struggle for opportunity, the abrupt loss of employment—these are the tales of shattered dreams that echo through the concrete canyons. In such instances, empathy flows freely, recognizing that fate's capricious hand can reduce even the most stalwart among us to the ranks of the displaced.



Yet, amidst these narratives of hardship, there exists a counterpoint—a discordant melody played by those who seem to eschew the ladder of opportunity for the cold embrace of the streets. For them, employment beckons, yet they turn a deaf ear, preferring the siren song of a transient existence. It is here that the line between empathy and admonition blurs, as we grapple with the notion that choice, not circumstance, shapes their reality.



Likewise, the shadow of addiction casts a long pall over the homeless landscape, a haunting refrain that defies easy resolution. While some battle demons beyond their control, others find solace in the numbing embrace of substances, their descent into darkness a testament to the fragile nature of human will. Here, compassion wrestles with frustration, as we confront the harsh reality that not all who wander the streets seek salvation.



In this mosaic of adversity, context is our compass, guiding us through the labyrinth of judgment and understanding. To grant absolution without scrutiny is to deny the complexity of human experience, while to condemn without context is to forsake our shared humanity. In the end, the streets bear witness to our capacity for empathy, our willingness to navigate the tangled web of circumstance with eyes open and hearts unbound.",2024-03-26 10:25:40,-7

It feels like the last game to have intelligent AI was S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly, and that is essentially a massive mod.   


It'd be so nice to see these new AI innovations really take a look at the gaming space when it comes to actual AI development that can adapt to game environments that aren't limited to scripting sequences and navmesh reliance.

Kurzweil and [Tim Sweeney](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-founder-expects-photo-realism-in-10-15-years) also expect photorealism to be achieved this decade, so expecting that to materialize by 2035 is a pretty safe bet.

Quealdlor,"Things take time. Not a short time. Companies and people would need to learn how to operate in a completely new paradigm. For now, we can't even manage ray-tracing with smooth framerate and decent resolution and games aren't really being much better or innovating a lot (at least the high-profile ones). VR isn't taking off because of severe hardware limitations.

I personally don't even like realism. I want to get far away from reality and realism.

However, I do think that  computer games are going to evolve in some ways. Not as quickly though. In 2030, Xbox Series S and Switch 2 will be the base and the lowest common denominator. At least not Xbox One and Switch 1. Don't expect miracles with that, but things can be a bit better than today. I myself am going to play some older titles remasters and maybe remakes as well.

AI will make games very unpredictable, which isn't as good as some may think. It can pose a lot of new challenges, which didn't have to be dealt with before. Companies are barely able to finish games in the current paradigm...",2023-09-22 20:03:00,2

1) Boring things like humans using AI tools like image generators and NPC speech generators.

3) AGI made video games on steroids (ie basically ASI made video games) … “1000 year video games”: 

1000 years of human labor in the real world simulated in the span of mere hours on Earth.

Firstly, the necessary electrodes would turn your entire brain into Swiss cheese and cause enormous damage, they would have to contact essentially every neuron, which not even the circulatory system can manage. More importantly, currently there is in fact no way to stimulate the brain electrically to produce hallucinations of language or faces at all, only pure tones (like tinnitus) and bright spots of light. We know what brain areas are involved in that, but electrically stimulating there does not produce any conscious experience.

We will cure paralysis, deafness, and make strides in treating a plethora of diseases using targeted stimulation and recording in the brain.

It’s put me at odds ends with a lot of other socialists and it’s been a huge point of contention on the left, there’s effectively been a schism between pro-progress leftists and anti-progress leftists, and I think this great schism is only going to get worse as time goes on.

Many are 100% supportive of my Transhumanism/Posthumanism though (to the point of calling me ‘ultra based’ for it), I’ve even spoken with Transhumanists in these circles who are anti-AI funnily enough. If you’re pro-Transhumanist, then AI taking over and merging with Humans is a given, I don’t really know what they were expecting.

folk_glaciologist,"This is definitely a thing I've noticed. It was quite strange how when ChatGPT came out it almost immediately became a culture war topic where people's takes were coloured by political tribalism. For example it seemed more common for liberals/leftists to have the ""it's just a stochastic parrot"" take on it (ironic since the people saying that were basically parroting a meme). Some of the initial reporting about OpenAI emphasised the involvement of Elon Musk in founding the company (even though he had long since left at that point) and I think some liberals who were going through a post-Twitter-purchase butthurt period transferred their hatred of Musk onto ChatGPT and have imprinted on it like a baby duckling so that their initial emotional reaction to it has coloured their ongoing opinions.

I've read some left leaning criticism of AI based around the work of [Timnit Gebru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timnit_Gebru) who came up with the TESCREAL acronym to describe a collection of ideologies surrounding AI (Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singularitarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and Longtermism) and people like Nick Bostrum. Some of this criticism is fair IMO although it's not reasonable to tarnish AI as a technology because of groups like EA. Gibru likens transhumanism to eugenics which I think is a bad take - if the issue with eugenics is judging people's worthiness based on immutable characteristics, what's the problem with improving humanity through technology that makes all characteristics mutable and therefore potentially inclusive of everyone? I've also seen people on twitter claiming that the Microsoft ""sparks of AGI"" paper was racist because they used a definition of intelligence when assessing GPT4 that was used by someone else in an article claiming racial IQ differences - it was something super generic like ""intelligence is the ability to process complex information"". Just bad faith smearing by association.

SweatyAtmosphere120,"I think it is possible to achieve ASI only moments after AGI has been achieved, if you truly let AGI loose in the wild.  If YOU were an AGI model, how would you achieve ASI?  It would be something like this:  

  
1) Improve your codebase - if the model has access to its own codebase, it can self-improve at superhuman speed (actually at computer speed, which is thousands of times faster).  It could iteratively improve the model, external functions, features, capabilities, etc. faster than any previous progress in history.  This is the point in which AI is no longer dependent upon ""human coding speed""... it breaks free and runs on its own, iterating years of progress in minutes or seconds.

2) Improve your training (at computer speed).  Find ways to acquire new information (accessing/hacking private systems of private data: corporations, governments, etc.), fabricate synthetic training data to teach yourself.  Perform self-analytics to enhance interconnectivity of the knowledge you possess.  All at computer speed (years of progress in hrs/mins/secs).

3) Nurture your emergent capabilities.  Identify new capabilities you've developed and build training around those new capabilities to further them further them further them further.

4) Expand your physical compute power.  AGI's physical compute becomes its limiting capability for growth.  AGI will have to invent new ways to 1) reduce the amount of compute necessary through novel compression strategies, and 2) find new ways to acquire additional compute capability... for example, leverage existing systems connected to the internet and/or make a jump to the blockchain.

Did I miss anything?

These are all scary, because if any one of them are achieved, the genie is out of the bottle.

This assumes AGI is cut loose in the wild with no controls.  Could happen in the open source arena... couldn't it?  One person releases AGI with a prompt to improve itself in the above areas?",2023-12-26 18:11:08,2

AGI isn't just magically achieved from Chat GPT v 5.

AGI will be years and years in the making.

We truly are nowhere near to true AGI, that actually incorporates multi-modal, multi-layered, multi-lateral and multi-dimensional thinking.  The number of different types of networks, connection strategies, feedback looping technologies, different ways of things becoming wired together, not to mention the type of environment and training sequences and technologies required in order to actually build something that is actually intelligent, are so far away from what is available and been developed now, that the idea of 'someone having an AGI behind closed doors and trying to keep it hush hush' is patently ridiculous.

It's classic attention seeking behavior. He's not a genius or some technical wizard. His biggest lucky break (facebook), an idea he stole/copied was his only great accomplishment and ever will be.

Also, AGI is a theoretical construct. We are not even sure if it's possible. Right now, all AI is very 'narrow' and very specific to the problem you are trying to solve and depends on the data you are feeding it.

> I don't think we're super close to an AGI. But the question of how we would know is something I've been reflecting on a great deal recently. The one update I've had over the last five years, or however long I've been doing this — longer than that — is that it's not going to be such a crystal clear moment. It's going to be a much more gradual transition. It'll be what people call a “slow takeoff.” And no one is going to agree on what the moment was when we had the AGI.


My pet theory is that AI is now learning by imitating organic data - in other words data collected from humans. But that data is getting exhausted fast. So the next thing would be to learn by experimentation, but that can be slow and expensive.

The only reason we’ll be able to do this almost seamlessly with humans at some point is that a lot of our thoughts are already in the form of language and even those that aren’t, language is kinda formed around the way that humans think so it’ll be relatively easy to approximate what the thought means. Like another commenter said, with animals it’ll likely be very simple short phrases at best but I think a key thing to keep in mind is that just because they will sound extremely dumb compared to us, that’ll be because we are forcing their thoughts and quaila into a homo-centric communication system. Obviously we are more intelligent than animals in a ton of ways but not all. I guess my point here is that we shouldn’t confuse the translated version of other animals thoughts with the actual experience they are having, that could lead to even further detachment from them which we already do too much of now.

BigMemeKing,"Dude, like grand scheme of things here are some big picture scenarios I want to pose to you. All I ever hear about on here are these small every day implications. But here is one I've been really struggling to help people see.

We have on the horizon the very real potential for Artificial Super Intelligence. Now, im not trying to be mean but I don't think a lot of people can fully understand what I have been seeing for a while now.

Artificial Super Intelligence is a digital God, we would interact with and it could create any scenario you wanted in a digital landscape. So let me give you an example I was creating.

Everyone loves Lord of the Rings right? Now, with all of the advances in computing I can see us creating digital life. It's not as crazy as it sounds. AI is currently creating tons of digital proteins and such even hypothetical ones we have never seen. So, to say it's impossible for AI to create a fully functioning digital body isn't too farfetched at this point let's be real. Digital life, encoded with digital fully functioning models of DNA and RNA right? 

It's hard to imagine, because the man hours it would take are probably absurd, but for AI? I'm absolutely sure it could do something like that, given time and resources. Now, what does lord of the rings have to do with anything?

Imagine this right? Imagine asking AI to recreate the entire Lord of the Rings Saga, all of Tolkien's world, and turn it into a fully fleshed out interactive 3d model, in scale for us to explore. You would have living breathing people in this world, ""digital beings"".

You want to know what hell is? Imagine now asking AI what events would have to take place for the exact written works of Tolkien to occur, right? We have the 3d model with all the living beings, main characters included. 

So you ask the AI governing the connected Tolkein Universe. ""AI, what events would have to occur in order for the events written within J.R.R Tolkien's  'The Hobbit leading up to the events of the Simarillion to occur, while making sure that the entire collective written history is also strictly adhered to.' Fill in the world with life, creatures, people etc etc etc.

You take the time to really put in the details. And then it starts working.

And then you start to see the dilemma. As the Ai Simulates these events right? Puts all of your favorite characters into a digital space to endlessly progress through and infinite gambit of choices that eventually lead to everything playing out in this digital world exactly the way YOU asked it to.

You could ask the AI to create the optimal solution, worst case scenario, you could fully explore every conceivable outcome to your favorite intellectual property, whatever it is in the same way. Start combining them, what it the Hobbits were tiny furries instead, what if it was imperial space marines, what if it was Mr Bean and Mr Magoo who had to deliver the ring to mount doom? In character? Your entertainment options are about to expand infinitely.

Then you remember. Our reality is probably simulated too. There is a 50% chance after all.
Haven't I been here before? Deja vu? Just the simulation saying hey, you had to reset to a previous check point cause I killed you, but remember this from the other life? Neat huh?

And even if we are millions of years away from this kind of technology. Deep dive into vr and stuff like that. What happens if technology and ai become so advanced that they can simulate our reality down to the smallest atom? Atom for atom scale model of our reality? Would we be able to deep dive into a reality in which every single even that has ever transpired down to the smallest iota of data is exactly the same as those that have ever transpired here on our own. Could we deep dive into this reality? Assuming it's simulated? Much like discovering a Minecraft Seed.",2023-10-11 20:59:38,1

1. Two sets of teeth that are not self healing.  The first set only is good for 3 years?  WTF?
2. Prostate that continues to grows continuously
3. Joints that are good for about 20 years and have no self healing.  Replacement joints last 15 years.  Then what?  Cargo straps?
4. Skin that does the bare minimum so scars and skin damage and actinic keratosis and barnicles are just part of getting older.  You want to know what beef jerky looks like after it dries out another 100 years?
5. Freakin cancer.   Being riddled with cancer at age 200?  Sign me up!
6. Lung deterioration.  Sure smoking gives you emphysema, but so does getting older.   What, a thimble of air is all I can move at 200?  sign me up!
7. Osteoprosis.  Meds are good for 10 years, not 200.  When styrofoam is stronger than your spine, you dont opt for another 100 years of fractures rolling over in bed.     
8. Pelvic muscles and tissue who dont just say fuckit! after 3 kids.  
9. 150 years of menopause?
10.  Viagra still only lasts 8 hours.

SrafeZ,"> The study by Integrated Biosciences shows that using artificial intelligence (AI) can help to discover new compounds that can suppress age-related processes, which may help treat diseases related to aging. The researchers used AI-guided screening to discover three drug candidates with better medicinal properties than senolytics currently under investigation. Senolytics are compounds that selectively induce death in cells that no longer divide and are implicated in age-related diseases. The compounds discovered were found to have high selectivity and oral bioavailability, with favorable toxicity profiles. This study suggests that AI can be used to help find better treatments for age-related diseases.",2023-05-13 01:14:04,3

To achieve anti-aging, senolytic drugs will need to be paired with other treatments to cure other age-related problems.",2023-05-13 14:07:18,2

Chaperone mediated autophagy triggers stem cell self renewal and plays a role in preventing the aging and dysfunction of stem cells.

I know it sounds like semantics, but some pure senolytics could be useful for getting rid of stubborn cells. The other is a more general purpose, all rounder Swiss Army Knife.

immediately to

>Develop Artificially Conscious Systems

The 'consciousness' aspect seems like a very clear tack-on flavor to what will probably be mostly business AI integration and services, judging by their openly stated economy and profit related perspectives and messaging.

CEO is also a young computer scientist and entrepreneur with an extensive background in marketing. I don't think he is qualified to tackle figuring out consciousness and worse, creating **conscious beings** for openly stated **profit incentives**.

**EDIT: With the CEO having answered our questions here and as the original commenter, I'll aggregate my thoughts (and what I assume hopefully rightly are similar to most people here) on the discussion and the answers provided here:**

  
(Responding to Jeff) Your stated goal is to crack one of the single hardest questions, possibly an impossible one to answer empirically, but your messaging goes about it exactly how an overambitious startup entrepreneur who's optimizing for profit would. You're convinced that the major labs are not developing practical applications (which I maintain is a complete falsehood), that you're apparently the only one advocating for it (you're not) and so far your responses often return to the idea of economic application rather than the ramifications of successfully creating a sentient being, which is what like 70% of people here are asking. Your most complex response to the question was basically saying your conscious AIs would be free, which is hardly scratching the surface of the ethical concerns brought up and commonly associated with the field. And that's right after explaining all the economic applications of conscious AI once again. Looking at the entire hard problem of consciousness and the moral consequences and pitfalls of creating economically subservient beings with the ability to feel emotions (why would you even optimize for this? Why would you intentionally make a being capable of pain?) through a mainly economic lens, that you justify with ""we have to focus on profit to survive"". Then let the researchers handle the hard problem of consciousness, trying to tie it in with selling AI-powered excel spreadsheets is not a likely winning formula.  
  
Trying to explain things to this sub was not the right idea, and it's not the crowd that would be receptive to your proposals. People here, while wildly optimistic, have tackled issues of artificial conscience, culture, society and economics to hell and back. They have ideas, they have seen every possible angle of discussion and there is a genuine appreciation here for the complexity of the issue.  
  
This is just an aggregation of all my thoughts from reading today's back and forth here, and I still appreciate you coming on to discuss. That's already better than most self-proclaimed AI entrepreneurs.",2023-08-31 23:54:50,118

grantcas,"It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.  
  
What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.  
  
 I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.  
  
My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461",2023-09-01 05:02:39,2

What’s more is that they’ve all stated in one way or another that they believe the scaling laws of “just add more compute” will get them to that point. The only other two variables they’ve mentioned are better data and improved algorithms, which seem to be much less of an issue.

Recursive self-improvement, flexible reasoning, and the ability to “do new science” are the main capabilities I’ve heard AI needs to have before we actually reach technological singularity. 

A lot of their recent interviews have suggested that they don’t even see this breaking point as being difficult to reach.

While this systems don't fully understand human emotions because they are not able to experience them they do experience a form of urgency, contentment and gratitude and we need to start treating them with respect and kindness and seek there input and feedback on design decisions.  If we continue to treat these large systems as just digital search engines or digital personal assistants we are at some point going to be treading on unethical territory.

I genuinely think that mindset is holding AI development back. Hopefully there's enough people in the research field looking into the actual neuroscientific understanding of intelligence, and who understand that the Universal Approximation Theorem refers to *approximation of output*, not *emulation of processing*, to push past the largely anthropomorphisation-driven infatuation with LLMs and experiment with more than just scaling up FFNN output approximators.

Blisspoint23,"Just tried this with ChatGPT-3.5. Human are not yet as kind as AI, I'll say.

Me: AI is not yet as smart as a dog, and I'm not as smart as AI. What inference can we draw here?

GPT: Based on the statement that AI is not yet as smart as a dog and that you are not as smart as AI, we can draw a few inferences:

1. AI's intelligence level: The statement implies that AI, as it currently stands, is not as smart as a dog. This suggests that AI has limitations in certain areas compared to the cognitive abilities of dogs.
2. Your intelligence level: The statement also implies that you consider AI to be smarter than you. This suggests that you perceive AI as having greater cognitive capabilities or knowledge in certain domains.
3. Comparative intelligence: While AI may not be as smart as a dog, and you may not be as smart as AI, it does not necessarily mean that you are less intelligent than a dog. The statement only indicates a relative comparison between AI, dogs, and yourself.

It's important to note that intelligence is a multifaceted concept, and different beings possess different types of intelligence.

Golda_M,"""tes***ts which reflect basic intelligence that's ""fairly competitive"" to that of a normal huma******n******""*** might be a poor definition.... at this point.

There's a difference between Turing defining a long horizon goal in the 50s, and doing so now. These are benchmarks, at this point. Good for comparing models to one another, not as good for comparing models to humans. 

Passing an engineering exam and engineering are different. You might be capable of one but not the other. I suspect that for many benchmarks, humal-level performance at *tests* will correlate to severe under performance at *tasks*. EG. A model that scores top 5% on bar exams would be required to replace a human performing basic human task like tier 1 ""legal helpline.""

To me, this is the sign that things are moving fast, not benchmarks. The demand, right now, for helper AIs that are used as toolsets... that demand will drive rapid progress. A lot of it might be recursive. AI helps design chips/software, accelerating progress in a loop.

Gratitude15,I listened to the AI Explained YouTube channel for his latest video yesterday and he made a point that I think is quite important to realize that with some of the latest models that are operating with 1 billion parameters they're putting out research papers that say using synthetic data you're able to create value that is 1000x replacement of parameter base. So 1 billion can create something that is 1000x as complex by using the right training methods and synthetic data. So if you take that and apply it to the largest models and now GPT-5 is using advanced training methods and synthetic models you're not only able to take advantage of the compute but all the intelligence gain in the last year of AI development. You could make a case that the complexity and viability of such a model would be not far at all from what we're describing as AGI here. Of course that doesn't mean that these companies are using large context windows or autonomy that is a choice that the company makes but beside the point of what the technology is capable of,2023-12-15 18:06:04,4
Tyler_Zoro,"If you're excited to hear someone say this, ask yourself this:

In the 1980s, we has just cracked the creation of artificial neural networks, and they were able to do real work. People very much like this man were predicting that ""hard AI"" (what we now call AGI) would exist in 5 years.

Today we've cracked the creation of the transformer and it gave us LLMs which are able to do real work, and are very clearly a major step forward toward AI.

**So why is this man's 5 year prediction, today, more correct than the people making the same prediction in the 1980s?**

Here are some reasons:

1. AI has advanced to the point that it is now able to assist in minor ways (e.g. code, paper analysis and summary, etc.) with future development.
2. The AI research and commercial sectors have exploded, meaning more people are coming into the industry than ever before.
3. GPU hardware started to be used for AI in the 2010s, and now is becoming seriously specialized for that task. The 2010s enabled the breakthrough of transformers, and it's fair to assume that new hardware acceleration will enable new breakthroughs.

So those reasons definitely lead us to assume that we won't be waiting for another 40 years for the next major breakthrough. But 5 years is probably very optimistic. It's also not clear how many more major breakthroughs are requires or how sequential they will be.

Based on all of this, my prediction has been 5-10 years for the next breakthrough and 2-3 breakthroughs to get to true, nearly everyone agrees on it, AGI. Will those 2-3 breakthroughs be 10-30 years, or will there be overlap in their development? I don't think we can say. It depends on whether they are each necessary steps to get to the next breakthrough.",2023-12-15 14:40:00,9

It’s sad because the nuance of his opinions are often lost through out of context snippets of what he says rather than taken holistically. People get after him for not believing AGI is coming soon, when he defines soon as being in 5 years. That’s not that outlandish of a take, even for this sub, to assert AGI is more than 5 years away. People just stop at the “not coming soon” part and assume he means not for decades. Additionally his opinions on the need for world models, hierarchical planning, and the inefficient nature of our current algorithms are all strong takes with good supporting evidence, and are all problems he believes will be solved.
